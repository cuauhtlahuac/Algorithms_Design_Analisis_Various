# Introduction to Algorithms Design Analisis.

Algorithm is a well defined set of rules for transforming input, namely for example two
numbers into an output, namely their product.

Many of the lectures in this course will follow a pattern.

## Integer Multiplication

[slides](../assets/algo1-intro2-annotated.pdf)

In the integer multiplication we have two integer numbers.

**Input**: Two n digitis numbers, x and y.

**Output**: The product x * y.

The amount of time depends of the number of basic operations.
The input is n.
